/cvmfs/sft-nightlies.cern.ch/lcg/views/dev3/Tue/x86_64-centos7-gcc11-opt/lib/python3.9/site-packages/xgboost/plotting.py:113: RuntimeWarning: More than 20 figures have been opened. Figures created through the pyplot interface (`matplotlib.pyplot.figure`) are retained until explicitly closed and may consume too much memory. (To control this warning, see the rcParam `figure.max_open_warning`). Consider using `matplotlib.pyplot.close()`.
